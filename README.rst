Terminator Manual (GTK2)
========================

Fully fleshed-out manual for Terminator.

The main Terminator icon was created by Cory Kontros, and provided under the `CC-BY-SA`_ licence.

This Manual and included images are wholly new pieces created by the current maintainer Steve Boddy, and are distributed under the `CC-BY-SA`_ licence, as are the horrific attempts by yours truly at using Coryâ€™s icon to provide page identities.
